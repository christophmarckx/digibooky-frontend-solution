  <h1>Story 18:</h1>
  <p>As an Admin I want to see an extra field containing the total amount of fines a member has, when viewing the members.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Enhances Story 7 (View members as Admin)</li>
  </ul>

  <h1>How to test?</h1>
  <p>Used Endpoint: GET â€¦/members</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Add a couple of members to your list of members and give the members some fines.</li>
    <li *ngIf="role == null">Login with an admin/librarian account or use the special admin/librarian login on the following link:
      <button routerLink="/login">Login</button>
    </li>
    <li *ngIf="role != null && (role != 'admin' && role != 'librarian')">Because you are logged in with an account, but not with an admin, you should click following link:
      <button routerLink="/logout">Logout</button>
      <br>Next, you should login with an admin account.
    </li>
    <li>
      Click on the following link
      <button *ngIf="role == 'admin'" routerLink="/members">members</button>
      <button *ngIf="role == 'librarian'" routerLink="/memberOverview">members</button>
      or on the "MEMBERS" link at the top of your screen, this will send you to the Member Overview Page.
    </li>
    <li>If everything works, you should see a list of your members and also the given fines.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>If something isn't there, possible solutions.</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>One of you variables isn't displayed?</p>
      <p>
        (This is mostly based on story 7, you can also check
        <button routerLink="/story7">story 7</button>
        ...)
      </p>
      <p>The used names for the variables aren't:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>To display the fines, "fines" should be bigger then 0</li>
        <li>For Total price: "totalPrice"</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
