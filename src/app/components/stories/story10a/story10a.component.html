  <h1>Story 10A:</h1>
  <p>As a Librarian I want to register a new book, so I can keep the collection of books relevant.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The ISBN, title and author's last name are required.</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>How to test?</h1>
  <p>Used Endpoint: POST â€¦/books</p>
  <ul>
    <li *ngIf="role == null">Login with an Librarian account or use the special librarian login on the following link:
      <button routerLink="/login">Login</button>
    </li>
    <li *ngIf="role != null && role != 'librarian'">Because you are logged in with an account, but not with an
      librarian, you should click following link:
      <button routerLink="/logout">Logout</button><br>Next, you should login with an librarian account.
    </li>
    <li>
      Click on the following link
      <button routerLink="/books/add">Add Book</button>
      Here you can add a new book.
    </li>
    <li>If everything works Fine, you should see the new registered Book.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>At this moment, you can only add a book if you are really logged in with username and password</h4>
