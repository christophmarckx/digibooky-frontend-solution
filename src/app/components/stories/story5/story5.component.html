  <h1>Story 5: Search a book by author</h1>
  <p>
    As a user I want to search for a book by entering a part of the author, so I can efficiently find a specific book. I
    should be able to enter wildcards if I don't know the complete name of the author. It should be possible to use only
    the first name, only the last name or both.
  </p>

  <h1>How to test?</h1>
  <h4>Used endpoint: GET â€¦/books?author=[author-part]</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Add a couple of books to your list of books.</li>
    <li>
      Click on the following link
      <button routerLink="/books">Books</button>
      or on the "BOOKS" link at the top of your screen, this will send you to the Book Overview Page.
    </li>
    <li>Here you can fill in the part of your authors name that you are looking for. The authors name should also work
      when you put only match a part of the name and not the whole name.
    </li>
    <li>If everything works Fine, you should see a list of your books with the asked author.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>If something went wrong, possible solutions.</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Make sure that you check the author correctly.</p>
      <p>In this UI, we check the authors first- and lastname</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>BTW: you can filter on all 3 the elements at the same time. (ISBN, title and author... did you do this correct?)</p>
