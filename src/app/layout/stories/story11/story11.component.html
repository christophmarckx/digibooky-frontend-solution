  <h1>Story 11:</h1>
  <p>As a member I want to be able to borrow a book, so that I can allocate a book to myself for a certain duration.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The member's user identification number and the book's ISBN should be provided.</li>
    <li>A unique lending identification number and a due date should be registered, by default this date is TODAY + 3 WEEKS</li>
    <li>A book can only be lent once at a time.</li>
  </ul>

  <h1>How to test?</h1>
  <p>Used Endpoint: POST â€¦/books/[ID]/[ISBN]/lend</p>
  <ul>
    <li *ngIf="role == null">Login with an Member account or use the special Member login on the following link:
      <button routerLink="/login">Login</button>
    </li>
    <li *ngIf="role != null && role != 'member'">You are logged in with an account, but not with an
      member, you should click following link:
      <button routerLink="/logout">Logout</button>
      <br>Next, you should login with an member account.
    </li>
    <li>
      Click on the following link
      <button routerLink="/books">Books</button>
      or on the "BOOKS" link at the top of your screen, this will send you to the Book Overview Page.
    </li>
    <li>Here you can choose a book that you would like to borrow from DigiBooky by clicking on the "Detail" button</li>
    <li>Now you should be on the details page from your chosen book.</li>
    <li>On this page you should see the "Lent Book" button.</li>
    <li>when you press this button, you should have borrowed the book.</li>
    <li>When the Profile story is already implemented, you can see the chosen book on the profile page.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>If something went wrong:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>The "Lent Book" button isn't available on the book details page</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Make sure you followed the above steps and you are really logged in.</p>
          <p>If you are sure you are logged in, check if your role is "member" and not something else</p>
          <p>to check this:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Press the right mouse button and select "inspect" (normally the last option you can choose)</li>
            <li>Now you should see that there is a box popping up in your browser, at the top of this box there are
              multiple options, one of them should be "Application"
            </li>
            <li>When you press on "Application", you see a "Storage" section</li>
            <li>In this section is the option "Session Storage", click on its the drop down button</li>
            <li>In this dropdown, should be the "http://localhost:4200" option, click on this</li>
            <li>When you clicked on this, you should see "Key" and "Value"</li>
            <li>Look under "Key" for the name "role" and check if that corresponding "Value" is "member"</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h4>At this moment, you can only borrow a book if you are really logged in with username and password</h4>
