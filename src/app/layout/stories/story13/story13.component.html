  <h1>Story 13:</h1>
  <p>As a Librarian I want to see all the books lent to a member, so I can keep track of how many books a member borrowed.</p>

  <h1>How to test?</h1>
  <ul>
    <li *ngIf="role == null">Login with an Librarian account or use the special librarian login on the following link:
      <button routerLink="/login">Login</button>
    </li>
    <li *ngIf="role != null && role != 'librarian'">Because you are logged in with an account, but not with an librarian, you should click following link:
      <button routerLink="/logout">Logout</button>
      <br>Next, you should login with an librarian account.
    </li>
    <li>
      Click on the following link
      <button routerLink="/memberOverview">members</button>
      OR click on the "MEMBERS" button on the top of your screen.
    </li>
    <li>Then click on the "VIEW PROFILE" button from your chosen member.</li>
    <li>If everything works Fine, you should see all the books this member borrowed.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>If something isn't there, possible solutions.</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>One of you variables isn't displayed?</p>

      <ul>
        <li>For Title: "title"</li>

        <li>For ISBN: "isbn"</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
