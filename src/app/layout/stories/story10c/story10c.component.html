  <h1>Story 10C:</h1>
  <p>As a Librarian I want to delete an existing book, so I can restrict members from borrowing books we no longer
    have.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Books should be soft-deleted. (Not sure what soft-delete means? Google or ask!)</li>
    <li>These books should no longer show up in any result!</li>
    <li>These books can no longer be borrowed!</li>
    <li>These books can be updated, they can be restored (un-deleted).</li>
  </ul>

  <h1>How to test?</h1>
  <p>Used Endpoint: DELETE â€¦/books/[ISBN]</p>
  <ul>
    <li *ngIf="role == null">Login with an Librarian account or use the special librarian login on the following link:
      <button routerLink="/login">Login</button>
    </li>
    <li *ngIf="role != null && role != 'librarian'">Because you are logged in with an account, but not with an
      librarian, you should click following link:
      <button routerLink="/logout">Logout</button>
      <br>Next, you should login with an librarian account.
    </li>
    <li>
      Click on the following link
      <button routerLink="/books">Book overview</button>
      OR press the BOOKS button at the top of your screen.
    </li>
    <li>Here you should click on a books details button.</li>
    <li>Then, you will see the Delete button</li>
    <li>If everything works Fine, you should see that the book is deleted.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>At this moment, you can only update a book if you are really logged in with username and password</h4>
