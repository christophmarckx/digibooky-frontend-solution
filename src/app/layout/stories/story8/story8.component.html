<div class="container">
  <h1>Story 8:</h1>
  <p>As an Admin user I want to register a new Admin user, so I can have multiple users with Administrator access.</p>

  <h1>How to test?</h1>
  <p>Used Endpoint: POST â€¦/admins</p>
  <ul>
    <li *ngIf="role == null">Login with an admin account or use the special admin login on the following link:
      <button routerLink="/login">Login</button>
    </li>
    <li *ngIf="role != null && role != 'admin'">Because you are logged in with an account, but not with an admin, you should click following link:
      <button routerLink="/logout">Logout</button>
      <br>Next, you should login with an admin account.
    </li>
    <li>
      Click on the following link
      <button routerLink="/admins/add">Add Admin</button>
      Here you can add an admin.
    </li>
    <li>If everything works Fine, you should see the new registered admin.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>At this moment, you can only add an admin if you are really logged in with username and password</h4>
